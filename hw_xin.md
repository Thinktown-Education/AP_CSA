Your program should work as shown below. Multiple runs of the programs are shown below.

### Sample Run 1:
```
Enter the first number:3

3 + 2 = 5
3 - 2 = 1
3 * 2 = 6

quotient of 7 divided by 3 = 2
remainder of 7 divided by 3 = 1
```

### Sample Run 3:
```
Enter the first number:1000
Enter the second number:10
1000 + 10 = 1010
1000 - 10 = 990
1000 * 10 = 10000
