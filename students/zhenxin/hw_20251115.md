# Problem 1 Rotate Array

Write two methods that rotate an integer array by exactly one position.

- `void rotateRightByOne(int[] nums)` — move every element one position to the right; the last element becomes the first.
- `void rotateLeftByOne(int[] nums)` — move every element one position to the left; the first element becomes the last.

Requirements:

- Modify the array `in-place` (do not allocate another array). You may use a constant number of temporary variables.
- Handle arrays of length 0 and 1 correctly (they should be unchanged).

Examples:

1) Right by one

```
nums = [1,2,3,4]
after rotateRightByOne(nums) -> [4,1,2,3]
```

2) Left by one

```
nums = [1,2,3,4]
after rotateLeftByOne(nums) -> [2,3,4,1]
```

Starter hints:

- For right rotation, save the last element, shift elements right, then place saved element at index 0.
- For left rotation, save the first element, shift elements left, then place saved element at the end.

Small test cases to try:

- `[]` -> `[]`
- `[7]` -> `[7]`
- `[1,2]` right -> `[2,1]`, left -> `[2,1]`


# Problem 2 Reverse Array
Write a method that reverses an integer array in-place.

- `void reverseInPlace(int[] nums)` — reverse the order of elements in `nums` so that the first becomes the last, the second becomes the second-last, and so on.

Requirements:

- Modify the array `in-place` using only O(1) extra space (a couple of temporary variables allowed).
- Handle arrays of length 0 and 1 correctly (they should be unchanged).

Examples:

```
nums = [1,2,3,4]
after reverseInPlace(nums) -> [4,3,2,1]
```

```
nums = [7,8,9]
after reverseInPlace(nums) -> [9,8,7]
```

Starter hints:

- Use two indices `i = 0` and `j = nums.length - 1` and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]` while incrementing `i` and decrementing `j` until `i >= j`.

Small test cases to try:

- `[]` -> `[]`
- `[5]` -> `[5]`
- `[1,2]` -> `[2,1]`
