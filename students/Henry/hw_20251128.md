## **FRQ 1: Classroom Grades (2D Object Array)**

A school stores student information in a 2D array of `Student` objects.
Each row represents a class period, and each column represents a seat.

```java
Student[][] roster;
```

The `Student` class is shown below.

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int score;

    public Student(String n, int s) {
        name = n;
        score = s;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getScore() {
        return score;
    }
}
```

### (a) `countPassing`

Write the method `countPassing`, which returns the number of students with a score **70 or higher**.

```java
public static int countPassing(Student[][] roster)
```

---

### (b) `highestScore`

Write the method `highestScore`, which returns the **highest score** in the roster.

```java
public static int highestScore(Student[][] roster)
```

---

### (c) `hasStudent`

Write the method `hasStudent`, which returns `true` if any student has the given name.

```java
public static boolean hasStudent(Student[][] roster, String targetName)
```

---

## **FRQ 2: Library System (ArrayList of Objects)**

A library stores its collection in an `ArrayList<Book>`.

```java
ArrayList<Book> library;
```

The `Book` class is defined below.

```java
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private int pages;

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public int getPages() {
        return pages;
    }
}
```

### (a) `countLongBooks`

Write the method `countLongBooks`, which returns how many books have **more than 300 pages**.

```java
public static int countLongBooks(ArrayList<Book> library)
```

---

### (b) `removeShortBooks`

Write the method `removeShortBooks`, which removes all books with **fewer than 100 pages**.

```java
public static void removeShortBooks(ArrayList<Book> library)
```

---

### (c) `averagePages`

Write the method `averagePages`, which returns the **average number of pages** in the library.

```java
public static double averagePages(ArrayList<Book> library)
```

---

## **FRQ 3: Seating Chart (2D Object Array + Logic)**

A theater seating chart is stored as a 2D array of `Seat` objects.

```java
Seat[][] seats;
```

Each `Seat` has the following methods:

```java
public boolean isReserved()
public double getPrice()
```

### (a) `countAvailable`

Write the method `countAvailable`, which returns the number of seats that are **not reserved**.

```java
public static int countAvailable(Seat[][] seats)
```

---

### (b) `totalRevenue`

Write the method `totalRevenue`, which returns the **total price** of all reserved seats.

```java
public static double totalRevenue(Seat[][] seats)
```

---

## **FRQ 4: Weather Station (2D Array + ArrayList)**

A weather station stores weekly temperature readings.

```java
int[][] temperatures;
```

### (a) `dailyAverages`

Write the method `dailyAverages`, which returns an `ArrayList<Double>` containing the **average temperature for each column**.

```java
public static ArrayList<Double> dailyAverages(int[][] temperatures)
```

---

### (b) `hasExtremeDay`

Write the method `hasExtremeDay`, which returns `true` if any temperature is **above 100 or below 0**.

```java
public static boolean hasExtremeDay(int[][] temperatures)
```

---

## **FRQ 5: Game Board (2D Object Array)**

A game board is stored as a 2D array of `Tile` objects.

```java
Tile[][] board;
```

Each `Tile` has the following methods:

```java
public boolean isBlocked()
public int getValue()
```

### (a) `countBlocked`

Write the method `countBlocked`, which returns the number of blocked tiles.

```java
public static int countBlocked(Tile[][] board)
```

---

### (b) `maxValue`

Write the method `maxValue`, which returns the **largest value** among all unblocked tiles.

```java
public static int maxValue(Tile[][] board)
```
