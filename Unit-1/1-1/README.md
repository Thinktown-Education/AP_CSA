Quiz: Can computers directly read a programming language?

Answer: No. Computers can only read machine code, which consist of 0s and 1s. How is a programming language translated into machine code? The answer is compiler. A compiler will **compile** programming language into machine code. Remember in Unit 0, after we run `FirstProgram`, the compiler will create the machine code for this program and name it `FirstProgram.class`. The `.class` file is written in machine code.
