# Unit 4-1 Ethical and Social Issues Around Data Collection

**Privacy & Security**:

- Using computers exposes users' personal privacy to risk. Programmers have a responsibility to protect user privacy when creating new software.
- Computer programs and their usage directly affect how secure personal information and data remain. These effects can help users or harm them.

**Algorithmic Bias**:

- Algorithmic bias occurs when a program consistently makes mistakes that unfairly disadvantage a particular group of users.
- Before using a data set to build or improve a program, programmers must understand how the data was collected and recognize that bias may exist in the collection process.
- Data sets with missing values or errors will cause programs to perform unreliably or inefficiently. Programs built on flawed data produce flawed results.

**Data Appropriateness**:

- A data set designed to answer one specific question or address one topic may not be suitable for answering different questions or addressing unrelated topics.
