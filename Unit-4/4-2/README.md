# 4.2 Data Sets

- **Data set**: A collection of specific pieces of information or data.
- Data sets can be manipulated and analyzed to solve a problem or answer a question. When analyzing data sets, values within the set are accessed and utilized one at a time and then processed according to the desired outcome.
- Data can be represented in a diagram by using a chart or table. This visual can be used to plan the algorithm that will be used to manipulate the data.

## Sample Data Set

| StudentID | Name | GPA | Grade | Attendance |
|-----------|------|-----|-------|------------|
| 1001 | Alice Johnson | 3.8 | 95 | 98% |
| 1002 | Bob Smith | 3.2 | 82 | 95% |
| 1003 | Charlie Brown | 3.5 | 88 | 100% |
| 1004 | Diana Prince | 3.9 | 92 | 97% |
| 1005 | Eve Wilson | 2.8 | 75 | 85% |
| 1006 | Frank Miller | 3.6 | 90 | 99% |

This table represents a student performance data set. Each row contains information about one student, and each column represents a different attribute (StudentID, Name, GPA, Grade, Attendance). A program could analyze this data set to find students with high GPAs, calculate average attendance, or identify students needing academic support.
